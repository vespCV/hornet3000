# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it through GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" feature on the Security tab of this repository.

Please note that this is a beta version of the project, and as a solo maintainer with limited time, I may not be able to respond to security reports immediately. I will address confirmed vulnerabilities as soon as my schedule permits.

## Security Measures

This project implements basic security practices including:

- Implementing the latest PyTorch version as soon as possible to address any security vulnerabilities in the current version
- Working on enhancing the security of the Raspberry Pi deployment when the system is operational in the field, including network security, physical security, and access controls

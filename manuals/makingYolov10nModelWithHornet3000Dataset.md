# Training a YOLOv10 Model for Vespa Classification on Google Colab

This manual guides you through training a YOLOv10 model for classifying different Vespa species on Google Colab. You can use a pre-trained model and the Hornet3000+ dataset (or your own labeled data) for this purpose.

Requirements:
- A Google account for Google Drive and Google Colaboratory

1. Download Vespa Dataset:

- Visit the [Hornet3000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcoryvandijk/vespa-velutina-v-crabro-vespulina-vulgaris) on Kaggle.
- Click **Download**

2. Move Data to Google Drive:
- Upload the `archive.zip` to a folder named `vespCV` in your Google Drive.

3. Open the notebook:
- Click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZYySGP85AOX187GFbzVVCnE-DFEFDOyT?usp=sharing) to open the notebook.

4. Download Training Results (Important):
- **Remember:** Training data and results are lost when you close the Colab notebook.
